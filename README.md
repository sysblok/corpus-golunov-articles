## Usage

All the texts are located in the [/corpus](/corpus) folder.

If you wish to feel more like a programmer (and maybe add some more text preprocessing), here is what you should do:

* Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) if you don't have Python;
* run `pip install -r requirements.txt`;
* run `cd crawler && scrapy crawl articles`.
